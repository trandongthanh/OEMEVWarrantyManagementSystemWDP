## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS FOR INTEGRATION**

### **Phase 1: Integrate New Components into Dashboards** 🔄

All components are built and ready - now integrate them into existing dashboards:

#### **Manager Dashboard Integration**:

- ✅ Import `CreateStockTransferRequestModal` and `StockTransferRequestList`
- ✅ Add stock transfer request page/tab
- ✅ Handle 409 errors in CaseLineDetailModal → trigger stock transfer modal
- ✅ Display active transfer requests with status

#### **Parts Coordinator Dashboard**:

- ✅ Import `ComponentPickupList` and `ComponentReturnForm`
- ✅ Create new "Component Management" section
- ✅ List reserved components awaiting pickup
- ✅ Track returned components

#### **Technician Dashboard Integration**:

- ✅ Import `CompleteDiagnosisButton`, `MarkRepairCompleteButton`, `ComponentInstallModal`
- ✅ Add "Complete Diagnosis" to diagnosis view
- ✅ Add "Mark Complete" to repair task cards
- ✅ Add component installation workflow

#### **Staff Dashboard Integration**:

- ✅ Import `CompleteRecordModal`
- ✅ Add "Complete Record" button to processing record details
- ✅ Integrate `AdvancedCaseLineFilters` into case line list view

---

### **Phase 2: Run Database Migration** 📦

```bash
# Run the new chat file upload migration
cd BE
npm run migrate:up
# Or manually run: node migrations/AddFileUploadToMessages.js
```

This will add `file_url` and `file_type` columns to the message table.

---

### **Phase 3: Testing Workflows End-to-End** 🧪

#### **Stock Transfer Flow**:

1. Manager creates stock transfer request (out of stock scenario)
2. EMV staff approves request
3. Company coordinator ships components
4. SC coordinator receives shipment
5. Verify stock levels updated

#### **Component Lifecycle Flow**:

1. Parts coordinator picks up reserved components
2. Technician installs component on vehicle
3. Parts coordinator returns old component
4. Verify all statuses transition correctly

#### **Repair Completion Flow**:

1. Technician completes diagnosis → case lines PENDING_APPROVAL
2. Staff/Manager approves case lines
3. Technician marks repairs complete
4. Staff completes processing record → COMPLETED

#### **Chat File Upload**:

1. Guest uploads image in chat
2. Staff receives message with image preview
3. Verify file stored in Cloudinary
4. Check database has file_url and file_type

### **Integration Pattern**

All components follow this pattern:

```typescript

import { StockTransferRequestList } from "@/components/dashboard/managerdashboard";

// 2. Get user role from auth
const { user } = useAuth();

// 3. Render with role
<StockTransferRequestList userRole={user.role} onRequestCreated={refetch} />;
```

### **No Breaking Changes**

All new components are additive - existing functionality remains untouched.

## 📞 **Questions to Answer**

Before starting implementation:

1. **Do you have designs/mockups for these new UIs?**

   - If not, I provided template code you can customize

2. **Who are the users testing this?**

   - Make sure you have test accounts for each role:
     - service_center_manager
     - emv_staff
     - parts_coordinator_company
     - parts_coordinator_service_center
     - service_center_technician

3. **What's your timeline?**
   - Critical features (stock transfer) should be done first
   - Other features can be phased

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

You'll know you're done when:

- [ ] Can complete a full warranty case end-to-end without errors
- [ ] Stock transfer request workflow works (create → approve → ship → receive)
- [ ] Component lifecycle tracked (pickup → install → return)
- [ ] All caseline statuses transition properly
- [ ] Processing records can be marked as completed
- [ ] Each role can perform their specific actions
- [ ] No console errors related to API calls
